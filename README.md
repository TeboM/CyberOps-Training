# 🥷 CyberOps-Training 
This repo will document and share my journey as I rebuild and solidify my knowledge and experience of cybersecurity principles, concepts and techniques through hands-on training  across various platforms


# 🛡️ Cyber Training Roadmap 2026

Welcome to my cybersecurity upskilling journey.

This repository documents my progression from core security foundations into blue team operations, incident response, threat hunting, and offensive security techniques.

While I explore multiple platforms, my primary starting point is **TryHackMe** (currently following the SOC Level 1 learning path) to build strong defensive and operational fundamentals. Other platforms such as **Hack The Box**, **CyberDefenders**, **PortSwigger**, and **BTLO** are incorporated to deepen hands-on exposure and broaden practical skills.
