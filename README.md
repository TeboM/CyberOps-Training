# 🥷 CyberOps-Training 2026
This is a live repo where I will document and share my journey as I rebuild and solidify my understanding and experience of cybersecurity principles, tools, concepts and techniques through hands-on training across various platforms.


# 🛡️ Cyber Training Roadmap 

Welcome to my cybersecurity upskilling journey.

This repository documents my progression from core security foundations into blue team operations, incident response, threat hunting, and offensive security techniques.

While I explore multiple platforms, my primary starting point is **TryHackMe** (currently following the SOC Level 1 learning path) to build strong defensive and operational fundamentals. Other platforms such as **Hack The Box**, **CyberDefenders**, **PortSwigger**, and **BTLO** are incorporated to deepen hands-on exposure and broaden practical skills.

## 🧠 Reflections & Notes

### Day 1 
> Continued with Cyber Defence Frameworks focusing on MITRE's D3FEND framework, where it is used and how to apply it in real-world situations.

### Day 2
> Further understanding of the D3FEND framework, applying preventative, mitigation and recovery measures against attacks
> Performing Credential Rotation - D3-CRO (to prevent attackers from reusing stolen credentials)
> Reviewing User Geolocation Logon Analysis to determine logon activity that deviates from a user's normal profile.
> Other MITRE Projects: Adversary Emulation Library is a resource of several emulations that mimic real-world attacks by known threat groups.
> Caldera - Automated adversary emulation tool that allows defenders to evaluate detection methods and perform I.R in a controlled environment, supports Red Team and Blue Team excercises.
> AADAPT (Adversarial Actions in Digital Asset Payment Technologies) covers tactics and techniques related to digital asset management systems. Helps defenders understand and mitigate threats targeting blockchain networks, smart contracts, digital wallets, and other digital asset technologies.
> ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) focuses on threats targeting artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. It documents real-world attack techniques, vulnerabilities, and mitigations specific to AI technology.
> Researched on the scope and techniques used in the Notepad++ supply-chain attack. This affected update requests that were intercepted and re-directed to attacker owned servers. Mostly impacting Orgs in East & SouthEast asia. 

### Day 3
> Uncovering common tactics and techniques leveraged by APT28 (Russia say's hi) when attacking Governement and non-government institutions, from Recon -> Resource Dev -> Initial Access -> Execution -> Persitence -> C2 -> Collection.
> Investigated a targeted Office365 Credential Harvesting campaign. Discovered artefacts about the phishing domain, phishing kit used, log file where credentials were stored, the attackers email addresses and final flag.
